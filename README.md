##DBProxy

DBProxy is a proxy for mysql client. In our developing work, we usually need to do something with database, like mysql.
But it seems not safe that we open our database to all of the developers. So we need a proxy for the database. We do the
contact with dbproxy, not the database directly. So it's much more safe.



##What DBproxy provide

* a server side which do the contact with real database is provided.
* a client api code generator is provided, it's writen by python, Synchronous and Asynchronous api are both provided.
